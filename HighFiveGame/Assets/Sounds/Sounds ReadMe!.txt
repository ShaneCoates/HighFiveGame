-- Super High Five Sounds --

SuperHighFiveMainTheme - the game's main theme. It can be played from the game's startup. 

SHFsunflower 1-11 - sounds the sunflowers make. To be played once the player starts encountering sunflowers. Can be set to play at random (meaning random clips, and at random intervals)

SHFambiance - background noise (nature). To be played once the player starts running, and stopped when the time is up. Clip goes for 31 seconds, so perfect for 30 second run.

SHFrunning - footstep sound effect. To be played once the player starts running, and stopped when the time is up. 

SHFhit 1-3 - The high-five sound that hitting a hand makes. 

SHFgameStartButton - sound for when the player hits "Start Game." Plays only when that button is hit.



NOTE: All sound levels are adjustable once you import them. The sound effects should be able to be heard clearly over the music, except ambiance. That can be quieter than the music. 
Sunflowers should be at the in-between level so they don't annoy players too much.
